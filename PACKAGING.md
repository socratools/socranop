Distribution Packaging Guide
============================

A `socranop` installation consists basically of four parts:

  * A Python library with the code and a few scripts using that code

  * Configuration files to configure D-Bus and the XDG Desktop menu

  * A udev rules file to allow unpriviledged users access to the USB
    device

  * Documentation files

The following describes the basic principles of the steps which build
my Fedora package, but they should be similar on other distributions.

  * Take the source code from the pypi tarball. FIXME: Wheel?!

  * Build, and install to `/usr` in a chroot `${chroot}`:

        python setup.py build
        python setup.py install --chroot ${chroot}

    These are the standard build and install commands for Python
    packages. There is nothing special here.

  * Run `socranop-installtool` to install files into `${chroot}`:

        env PYTHONPATH=${chroot}/usr/lib/python3.8/site-packages \
		${chroot}/usr/bin/socranop-installtool --post-install --chroot=${chroot}

    This installs the D-Bus config files, the XDG desktop menu and
    icon files, and a file with udev rules.

    The default udev rules file action is to `TAG+="uaccess"` which on
    modern distributions will ensure access for locally logged in
    users. If you need to set permissions in another way, you can
    change `${chroot}/usr/lib/udev/rules.d/70-socranop.rules`
    accordingly or add additional udev rule files.

    See [PERMISSIONS.md](PERMISSIONS.md) for more details.

  * Remove the `${chroot}/usr/bin/socranop-installtool` script file and
    from the `.../site-packages` directory remove the
    `socranop/installtool.py` file and the `socranop/data` directory
    tree (FIXME: Remove the complete data/ tree? Really?)

	Those files will not be needed in the distro package, as those
    files were only needed to install files into `${chroot}` which we
    have just done in the previous step.

  * Move `${chroot}/usr/bin/socranop-session-service` to
    `${chroot}/usr/libexec/socranop-session-service` and change
    the `Exec` line inside the
    `${chroot}/usr/share/dbus-1/services/io.github.socratools.socranop.service`
    file accordingly (using `sed`).

	Not all distributions mandate the use of `/usr/libexec` for
    service executables, and this is not necessary for a
    `socranop` distro package to work, but it does work if
    your distribution requires it.

  * Install documentation files into `${chroot}`.
