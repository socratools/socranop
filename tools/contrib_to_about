contrib-to-about - convert CONTRIBUTORS.md to python module

Usage:
   tools/contrib-to-about

This reads `../CONTRIBUTORS.md` and writes a new python module
`../socranop/contributors.py` if necessary and requested. The file
locations are determined relative to the location of the
`contrib-to-about` script file.

Options:
    --check
        Only check whether the file would change; never actually change it.
        The exit code will be non-0 if the file would be changed.
    --diff
        Only show the changes which would be done to the python module as
        a `diff -u` patch; never actually change it.
        The exit code will be non-0 if the file would be changed.
    --git-add
        If changes were made, automatically stage these changes for
        commit.
    --help
        Show this message and exit.

The --check and --diff options mimick the behaviour of the `black`
source code formatting tool.
