.SH NAME
.PP
socranop-permissions - setting up USB device permissions for use with
socranop
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[V]socranop-session-service\f[R] D-Bus service and the
\f[V]socranop-ctl --no-dbus\f[R] CLI skipping the D-Bus service change
the mixer audio routing by opening and writing to the device special
file corresponding to the mixer.
.PP
By default, the device special file cannot be written by unpriviledged
users and since the \f[V]socranop-session-service\f[R] D-Bus service and
the \f[V]socranop-ctl --no-dbus\f[R] CLI run as an unpriviledged user,
the device special files\[cq]s permission must be opened up to allow
write access to \f[V]socranop-session-service\f[R].
.PP
A new device special file is created every time the mixer device is
connected to the host, so changing the device file\[cq]s permissions by
running commands like \f[B]chown\f[R](1), \f[B]chgrp\f[R](1),
\f[B]chmod\f[R](1), \f[B]setfacl\f[R](1) will only be temporary.
.PP
The operating system has a set of rules which change device file
permissions whenever a device file is created.
There are many ways to do this, but the following are some of the most
commonly-used mechanisms.
.SH Linux/udev
.PP
On Linux, the device special file is called something like something
like \f[V]/dev/bus/usb/006/014\f[R], and the the device permissions are
set by \f[B]udev\f[R](7) which can be configured by dropping rule files
into a special location in the filesystem.
.PP
The rule files are typically named something like
\f[V]/etc/udev/rules.d/70-socranop.rules\f[R].
.PP
Every rule consists of a part to match a particular type of device (with
comparison operators such as \f[V]==\f[R]), and a part which does
something about that device, such as modifying or setting a variable
(e.g.\ \f[V]+=\f[R] or \f[V]=\f[R]), changing its file mode or ownership
or file ACL.
.SS Allow all local users
.PP
Setting \f[V]TAG+=\[dq]uaccess\[dq]\f[R] allows access to users with a
local login session.

.SS Allow access for all members of the audio group
.PP
Setting the device file\[cq]s group to \f[I]audio\f[R] allows all users
in the \f[I]audio\f[R] group access.
.PP
This is useful if you are for example remotely logging in via ssh and
want to run \f[B]socranop-ctl\f[R](1).
You could also choose to create a new group for this purpose instead of
reusing the operating system\[cq]s default \f[I]audio\f[R] group.

.SH FILES
.SS Linux/udev
.TP
/dev/bus/usb/NNN/MMM
The USB device file
.TP
/etc/udev/rules.d/
This is where the local system\[cq]s administrator write their udev rule
files.
.TP
/usr/lib/udev/rules.d/
This is where operating system packages typically install their udev
rule files.
.TP
/usr/local/lib/udev/rules.d/
This is where installations to /usr/local packages typically install
their udev rule files.
